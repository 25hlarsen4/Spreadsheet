# Comments to Evaluators:

I have no comments at this time as my work currently stands on its own.

# Assignment Specific Topics:

No additional write up was required by this assignment.

# Consulted Peers:

When coming up with test cases, I did not consult with any peers because I felt as though I had thought of enough
cases and enough cases were given in lecture to the point where I felt my tests were exhaustive enough without outside 
help. Furthermore, I did not consult with any peers when resolving failed test cases because whenever I ran into a 
test case that failed, I was able to figure out the problem fairly quickly on my own, otherwise I would have 
sought help eventually.
