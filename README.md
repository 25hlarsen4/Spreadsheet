# Overview of the Spreadsheet Functionality:

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of evaluating valid mathematical expressions without negative integers,
and the only operators allowed are +, -, *, /, (, and ).
Variables are also allowed, and their values are lookup up using a delegate. 
Future extensions are still unclear, but the eventual goal is to have a spreadsheet with this evaluating ability built in.
