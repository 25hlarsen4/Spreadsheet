# Overview of the Spreadsheet Functionality:

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of evaluating valid mathematical expressions without negative integers,
and the only operators allowed are +, -, *, /, (, and ).
Variables are also allowed (of the form of one or more upper or lower case letters followed by one or more digits), 
and their values are looked up using a delegate. 
Furthermore, the Spreadsheet program has the capability to make dependency graphs to represent the dependencies between 
cells in a spreadsheet.
Future extensions are still unclear, but the eventual goal is to have a spreadsheet that can keep track of dependencies
between cells to then be able to accurately compute and update formulas in the cells.

# Time Expenditures:

Assignment 1 - Formula Evaluator:   	Predicted hours: 12  	   Actual hours: 11\
Note: No serious hangups arose, so my time spent working was evenly distributed amongst the assignment tasks.

Assignment 2 - Dependency Graph:		Predicted hours: 13		   Actual hours: 12\
Note: No serious hangups arose, so my time spent working was evenly distributed amongst the assignment tasks.
