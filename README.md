# Overview of the Spreadsheet Functionality:

As of the completion of Assignment 1, the Spreadsheet program was capable of evaluating valid mathematical 
expressions without negative integers, and the only operators allowed were +, -, *, /, (, and ).
Variables were also allowed (in the form of one or more upper or lower case letters followed by one or more digits), 
and their values were looked up using a delegate. 
As of the completion of Assignment 2, the Spreadsheet program had the capability to make dependency graphs to represent 
the dependencies between cells in a spreadsheet.
Now, as of the completion of Assignment 3, a more generalized version of the evaluating functionality created in 
Assignment 1 has been achieved. There is now a Formula class with an Evaluate method within it, and it has been updated 
to work on doubles. Furthermore, several methods have been implemented to work on Formula objects.
Future extensions are still unclear, but the eventual goal is to have a spreadsheet that can keep track of dependencies
between cells to then be able to accurately compute and update formulas in the cells.

# Time Expenditures:

Assignment 1 - Formula Evaluator:   	Predicted hours: 12  	   Actual hours: 11\
Note: No serious hangups arose, so my time spent working was evenly distributed amongst the assignment tasks.

Assignment 2 - Dependency Graph:		Predicted hours: 13		   Actual hours: 12\
Note: No serious hangups arose, so my time spent working was evenly distributed amongst the assignment tasks.

Assignment 3 - Refactoring the FormulaEvaluator:		Predicted hours: 12		   Actual hours: 12\
Note: No serious hangups arose, so my time spent working was evenly distributed amongst the assignment tasks.
