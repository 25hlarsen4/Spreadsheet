# Overview of the Spreadsheet Functionality:

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of evaluating valid mathematical expressions without negative integers,
and the only operators allowed are +, -, *, /, (, and ).
Variables are also allowed (of the form of one or more upper or lower case letters followed by one or more digits), 
and their values are looked up using a delegate. 
Future extensions are still unclear, but the eventual goal is to have a spreadsheet with this evaluating ability built in.
