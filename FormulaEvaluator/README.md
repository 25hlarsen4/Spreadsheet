# Comments to Evaluators:

I have no comments at this time as my work currently stands on its own.

# Assignment Specific Topics:

No additional write up was required by this assignment.

# Consulted Peers:

I did not consult with any peers on this assignment because I tend to like struggling through a problem on my
own until I have tried everything I can think of, and on this particular assignment, I was able to solve all the
problems I ran into without running out of ideas, so I therefore did not end up consulting others for help.
