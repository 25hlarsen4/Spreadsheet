# Partnership:
All code was completed via pair programming. 


# Branching:
An A6Development branch was created for us to work on this assignment separate from the main branch.


# Additional Features and Design Decisions:
Our additional feature was a clear entry button. If the user wants to delete a cell with particularly long contents, instead 
of backspacing everything and hitting enter, they can simply select the desired cell by clicking on it and then hit the 
'clear entry' button provided. Furthermore, dependent cells will not be cleared in case they want the dependencies to remain.
In terms of our design decisions, we decided it would be easiest to use the starter code we were given, but we added extra 
labels/ entries to the top bar to make the GUI look more visually pleasing.


# Comments to Evaluators:
Maui had issues with us setting a default focused cell, but a TA said that it was not a requirement and to not worry about it 
as MAUI had issues with it last year as well.


# Assignment Specific Topics:
No additional write up was required by this assignment.


# Consulted Peers:
We only consulted with each other as partners and TAs on Piazza.
