# Comments to Evaluators:

I have no comments at this time as my work currently stands on its own.

# Assignment Specific Topics:

No additional write up was required by this assignment.

# Consulted Peers:

While I consulted with a peer on the Formula class that this class tests (as mentioned in the Formula project README),
I did not consult with any peers regarding the actual testing class, since I felt that I was able to think of enough
test cases on my own.
